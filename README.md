# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (EECS 215)
A repository where I write python code for all algorithms taught in the course EECS 215 at UCI. Run any script by running the terminal command `python script.py`. The only dependancy is python3.

### `gale_shapley.py` An implementation of the male optimal Gale-Shapley Algorithm.
### `graph_traversal.py` An implementation of basic Breadth First Search and Depth First Search graph traversal algorithms.
### `check_bipartite.py` An application of the BFS algorithm to check if a given undirected graph is bipartite or not. Uses the 2-coloring approach.
### `topological_ordering.py` Returns the topological ordering of a Directed Acyclic Graph.
